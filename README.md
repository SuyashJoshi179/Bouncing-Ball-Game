# Bouncing-Ball-Game
### A game made from C++ and OpenGL.
This interactive game is made using openGL. In this game, you have to keep the ball in the game window by preventing it from falling. There is a ball which you can bounce using the space key. There are platforms which have randomly generated length and height(out of three heights). You have to press the space button on the right moments such that ball lands from one platform to another. The game is infinite and the more you stay, more you score.
